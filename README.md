## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to **process** and **clean** the dataset, create insightful **visualizations**, and derive meaningful insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI).

## Key Components

1. **Data Processing and Cleaning**
   - Initial data exploration
   - Handling missing values
   - Data normalization and transformation

2. **Visualization**
   - Generating plots to understand data distribution
   - Visualizing relationships between variables

3. **Modeling Techniques**
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**
   - **Polynomial Regression**
   - **Regularization Models** (e.g., Lasso, Ridge)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Conducting **cross-validation** to ensure model robustness
   - Performing **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance

5. **Model Deployment**
   - Creating **pickle files** for model serialization
   - Testing the model on **unseen data** to evaluate its predictive power
